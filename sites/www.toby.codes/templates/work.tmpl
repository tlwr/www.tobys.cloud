    <h3>Power measurement for smartmeter P4 ports</h3>
    <p>
      In the Netherlands, there is a standard for how power meters should
      expose usage information. This is the P4 port (RJ11) data which periodically sends
      datagrams via 115200 baud serial.

    <p>
      In multiple homes I have built and installed a
      <a href="https://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> + wifi
      monitoring solution. Energy usage data is collected and stored in the
      cloud and viewable via <a href="https://grafana.org">Grafana</a>
      dashboards.

        over a week. In this home, grid delivery is measured directly from the smart meter.

        Grafana panel showing grid consumption (stroomverbruik) versus energy
        generation (opwekking) over 6 hours. in this home, grid consumption is
        measured by the smart meter, but energy generation can be measured from
        the solar relay (enphase).

        Grafana panel showing grid consumption (verbruik) versus energy
        generation (opwekking) over 24 hours. in this home, grid consumption is
        measured by the smart meter, but energy generation can be measured from
        the solar relay (enphase). In this iteration there is also 1 kWh
        battery (ecoflow) that is charged during the day.
